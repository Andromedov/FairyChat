  ## Installation
  
  You need to have [Paper](https://papermc.io/) (or fork of paper) installed on your server. FairyChat is not
  compatible
  with other server software.
  
  It's also important to have MiniPlaceholders installed on your server. You can download it
  from [here](https://modrinth.com/plugin/miniplaceholders).
  
  For the best experience, you also should install the player expansion for MiniPlaceholders. You can download it
  from [here](https://github.com/MiniPlaceholders/Player-Expansion).
